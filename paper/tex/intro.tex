\section{Introduction}
\subsection*{What's the problem}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Parallel hardware + software hard to reason about
  \item Too many combinations to hand-tune
  \item Existing approach either over or under provision parallelism
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Why does it matter?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Parallelism is here to stay both in hardware and software
  \item Challenges listed above make more important to have automated methods (we don't program in assembly anymore unless we have to)
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Who cares?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cloud providers / clusters pack many applications onto machines
  \item In large applications that take up entire machine, easier to create many threads
  \item In distributed systems, also easier since performance bottlenecks are elsewhere, but can see similar per-node improvements
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Observe that dynamically scaling parallelism can improve system performance (throughput, latency)
  \item User-level coordinator to determine appropriate level of parallelism for registered applications
  \item Thread library that can dynamically scale application parallelism
\end{itemize}
