  \caption{Wall-clock execution times for a job consisting of 16 instances of the PARSEC benchmark application \texttt{fluidanimate}. In each observation, we start the 16 instances simultaneously, all with the same number of threads (varied in along the x-axis). Parallel applications are designed to perform better with more units of execution, but performance can quickly degrade under contention.}
