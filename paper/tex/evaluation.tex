\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Workloads}
Different classes of applications. Mixture of applications.

Should we have single large application?

How should we handle unstructured parallel programs (e.g., web server?)

\subsection{Comparison with other thread libraries}
OS (pthreads), OpenMP, Intel TBB
\subsection{Varying guarantees (CPU share / quota)}

\subsection{Various machines}
