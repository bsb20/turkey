\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Workloads}
Different classes of applications. Mixture of applications.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What workloads are helped a lot
  \item What are not really affected
  \item What are harmed
\end{enumerate}

Should we have single large application?

How should we handle unstructured parallel programs (e.g., web server?)

\subsection{Comparison with other thread libraries}
OS (pthreads), OpenMP, Intel TBB
\subsection{Varying guarantees (CPU share / quota)}

\subsection{Various machines}

\subsection{How much work for using?}
