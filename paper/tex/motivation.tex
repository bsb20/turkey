\section{Motivation for a dynamic parallelism}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many cores are here to stay. Need more automated methods to take advantage of. \cite{baumann2009multikernel}
  \item OS schedulers already quite complex. Must serve many masters; hard to make changes without harming certain workloads. Don't want to change the kernel if we can improve performance in user space \cite{lozi2016linux}
  \item Applications are being increasingly run in containers / VMs on a single host
  \item Centralized schedulers in distributed systems struggle to scale \cite{ousterhout2013sparrow}
\end{itemize}
