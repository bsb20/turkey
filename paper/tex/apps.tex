\section{Benchmark applications}

\begin{itemize}
  \item TODO: do we want a single large application (e.g., provisioned for KNL, but running on much smaller VM for some reason)?
  \item TODO: What about an unstructured application (e.g., web server)?
  \item TODO: What about long-lived application (e.g., streaming)? We can probably simluate this via streamcluster
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SPLASH-2}
TODO: maybe leave this out given timing
